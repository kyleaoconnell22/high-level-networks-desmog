# high-level-networks-desmog

Code for the paper `Resolving high-level phylogenetic networks with repeated hybridization in a complex of polytypic salamanders (Caudata: Desmognathus)`.

The file 'DeepQuartets.R' contains two R funtions to perform the method described in the manuscript. It also contains an example on how to use these functions.

The file '7taxtaTree.Rdata' is a file required by the function Displayed_Trees() in 'DeepQuartets.R'

The file Example_network contains simulated gene trees using Hybrid-lambda (Zhu et al 2013) for the network described in the example section in the file 'DeepQuartets.R'. This file is used to exemplify the use of the functions and the output of such.
